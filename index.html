    <h1>Cardan Greenbriar @ Jude Duarte quotes across The Folk of the Air Trilogy</h1>
    <p> "You defied me. More than once. Your only hope is to throw yourself on my mercy in front of everyone. Do it, or I will keep on hurting you until there is nothing left to hurt." - The Cruel Prince(76)
        "Very well. I hate you because your father loves you even though you're a human brat born to his unfaithful wife, while mine never cared for me, though I am a prince of Faerie. I hate you because you don't have a brother that beats you." - The Cruel Prince(306)
        "Most of all, I hate you because I think of you. Often. It's disgusting, and I can't stop." - The Cruel Prince(307)
        "I wasn't kind, Jude. Not to many people. Not to you. I wasn't sure if I wanted you or if I wanted you gone from my sight so that I would stop feeling as I did, which made me even more unkind. But when you were gone - truly gone beneath the waves - I hated myself as I never have before." - The Wicked King(200)
        "By you, I am forever undone." - The Queen of Nothing(151)</p>
