  <h1>"I started stanning SeolaA from WJSN and I instantly got skinnier," says UJUNG from the state of Washington.</h1>

    <h2> Here is a list of WJSN members that stand out </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exy - I don't think any UJUNG can deny that Exy is a very remarkable rapper. Did you know that before SeolA Exy was the 'it' girl of Cosmic girls? She literally had maybe 50% of "Catch Me" dedicated to her rapping while everyone else minus Cheng Xiao sang "I'm coming" in the chorus.</li>
      <li>Cheng Xiao - is one of three Chinese members in WJSN and she stand outs with her flexibility and unique flipping ability. Xiao is not currently promoting with the group as she makes a lot more money in China. She is alledgely the only millionare in WJSN, and that happened within a year of joining the group.</li>
      <li>Luda - HAHA BEETCH you probably thought I was gonna put Bona ? Well no because Luda looks like a doll. And I mean that as a compliment because American Girl Doll Russian Nesting Dolls could never be as talented as Luda</li>
