  <h1>Cetaphil cleanser: "I got skinny. And now I have wings."</h1>
    <h1> Here is a list of WJSN members that stand out </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> <h2>Exy - I don't think any UJUNG can deny that Exy is a very remarkable rapper. Did you know that before SeolA Exy was the 'it' girl of Cosmic girls? She literally had maybe 50% of "Catch Me" dedicated to her rapping while everyone else minus Cheng Xiao sang "I'm coming" in the chorus.</h2></li>

      <li> <h2>Cheng Xiao - is one of three Chinese members in WJSN and she stand outs with her flexibility and unique flipping ability. Xiao is not currently promoting with the group as she makes a lot more money in China. She became a millionare within a year of joining the group.</h2></li>

      <li> <h2>Luda - Luda looks like a doll. And I mean that as a compliment because American Girl Doll Russian Nesting Dolls could never be as talented as Luda</h2></li>
